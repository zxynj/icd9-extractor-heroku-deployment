<h2>Analyze Medical Note</h2>
<p>This is app will use take medical notes (discharge summary, office visit note...) and output a list of potential ICD9 codes.</p>
<p>Note examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/zxynj/icd9-extractor-heroku-deployment/tree/master/Note%20Examples">here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the memory limitation of Heroku, each model has to be loaded all again when making a new prediction. Therefore it takes couple minutes to see the result. Even by doing this user will still experience memory exceeded error, so all dynos are set to restart every 10 mins.</p>

History of Present Illness: Mr.  is a 56 yo male with coronary artery disease, whopresented to  on  for an elective CABG.Past Medical History:CAD/MI ()HTNHyerlipidemiaDMPhysical Exam:Alert, oriented, well-nourished, comfortableChest clear bilaterallyRRRAbdomen soft, nontenderExtremities warm, well-perfusedBrief Hospital Course:Mr.   CABG x5 on , which he tolerated well(see Op Note).  He was transferred to the cardiac intensive careunit post-operatively, as per routine.  He was extubated soonthereafter. It should be noted that this patient is a difficultintubation, but with the close assistance of anesthesia, therewere no issues with extubation. He would remain in stablecondition throughout his hospital stay.  His chest tubes wereremoved on POD 1, and he was transferred from the ICU to thefloor in stable condtion.  He was soon ambulating easily andoften on his own.  On POD 3, he did have a fever, however, hecontinued feeling well.  His wound showed no signs of infection. A chest x-ray revealed no abnormal findings.  His WBC on POD 4was within normal limits.  On POD 5, with Mr.  feelingwell, ambulating easily, his sternum stable, and with his woundappearing to be healing well, he was discharged to home in goodcondition.  He will follow-up within the next month forpost-operative evaluation with Dr. .

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Abnormal ECG. Chest pain. Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time:  at 09:24
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of theLA. No mass/thrombus in the   LAA. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen inthe LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus in the LAA
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous echo contrastin the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA andextending into the RV. No spontaneous echo contrast in the RAA. No thrombus inthe RAA. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. The IVC isnormal in diameter with appropriate phasic respirator variation.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2Dimages. Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Normal LV wall thickness.Normal LV cavity size. No LV aneurysm. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.Mildly depressed LVEF. No LV mass/thrombus.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior- normal; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal -hypo; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior -normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral- normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anteriorapex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex -normal; apex - hypo;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic root. Normalascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aorticarch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aortadiameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No masses or vegetationson aortic valve. Filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets c/with Lambl'sexcresences (normal variant). No AS. Trace AR.MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No mass or vegetation onmitral valve. Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillarymuscles. No MS. Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets withphysiologic PR.

The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The TEE probe waspassed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast isseen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the leftatrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in theleft atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. Nospontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No thrombusis seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D orcolor Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity sizeis normal. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen. There is mild regional leftventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic functionis mildly depressed. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include apical, anterior andanterior septal hypokinesis.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wallmotion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There aresimple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in theaortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Theaortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seenon the aortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leafletsconsistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic valvestenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets aremildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivialmitral regurgitation is seen.

Sternal and mediastinal dsgs,CDI. RIJ with PA cath placed, waveform sharp. CI 2.10. 500cc bolus fluid given. R radial a-line placed, waveform sharp. Pedal pulses, weak but palpable.
RESP:LS clear, dim. bilaterally. remains intubated. Reversals given and propofol off.  Unable to lift head off pillow at this time. ABG's show fluid deficit,  fluids infusing.
ENDO: Insulin gtt per CSRU protocol.
SOCiAL: Friend at , updated on surgery and ICU orientation.
PLAN: hemodynamic monitoring, pulmonary toilet, may have to keep intubated until a.m, mobilize, treat and D/c to the floor. 
CSRU NPNNEURO: A/O X3 PLEASANT. MAE TO COMMAND & SPONTANEOUSLY. AFEBRILE. TORADOL IM FOR PAIN. CV: SR, RARE PAC'S. A/V WIRES INTACT AND FUNCTIONING. NEO OFF/ON TO MAINTAIN SBP >90. FLUID BOLUSES GIVEN FOR LOW MIXED VENOUS O2 SAT, LOW CVP, LOW PAD, LOW B/P WITH GOOD RESULTS - SEE CAREVUE. CO/CI BY THERMODILUTION CORRELATES WITH FICK. CT WITH S/S DRAINAGE.RESP: EXTUBATED AT 1900, WEANED TO 2LNC WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. LUNGS CLEAR WITH DIM BASES. INSTRUCTED ON USE OF COUGH PILLOW AND I/S. I/S TO . NO COUGH/CONGESTION. PT HAS AUDIBLE SNORE WHEN SLEEPING. SPO2 >98%.GI: TOLERATING CLEAR LIQUIDS. HYPO BS, R>L. NO FLATUS, NO BM.GU: FOLEY PATENT. HUO ADEQUATE.ENDO: INSULIN GTT PER CSRU PROTOCOL.
