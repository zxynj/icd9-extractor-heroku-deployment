He was transferred to the cardiac intensive careunit post-operatively, as per routine.  He was extubated soonthereafter. It should be noted that this patient is a difficultintubation, but with the close assistance of anesthesia, therewere no issues with extubation. He would remain in stablecondition throughout his hospital stay.  His chest tubes wereremoved on POD 1, and he was transferred from the ICU to thefloor in stable condtion.  He was soon ambulating easily andoften on his own.  On POD 3, he did have a fever, however, hecontinued feeling well.  His wound showed no signs of infection. A chest x-ray revealed no abnormal findings.  His WBC on POD 4was within normal limits.  On POD 5, with Mr.  feelingwell, ambulating easily, his sternum stable, and with his woundappearing to be healing well, he was discharged to home in goodcondition.

No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of theLA. No mass/thrombus in the   LAA. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen inthe LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous echo contrastin the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA andextending into the RV. No spontaneous echo contrast in the RAA. No thrombus inthe RAA. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. The IVC isnormal in diameter with appropriate phasic respirator variation.LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2Dimages. Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Normal LV wall thickness.Normal LV cavity size. No LV aneurysm. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.Mildly depressed LVEF.

I certifyI was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE relatedcomplications. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The TEE probe waspassed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.Conclusions:PRE-CPB: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast isseen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the leftatrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in theleft atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. Nospontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No thrombusis seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D orcolor Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity sizeis normal. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen. There is mild regional leftventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic functionis mildly depressed. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include apical, anterior andanterior septal hypokinesis.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wallmotion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There aresimple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in theaortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Theaortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seenon the aortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leafletsconsistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic valvestenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets aremildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivialmitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.POST-CPB: Biventricular systolic function is preserved with LVEF 40-45%. RWMAas described. Trqace MR,TR,PI,AI as pre-cpb. On phenylephrine infusion. Sinus rhythm.
