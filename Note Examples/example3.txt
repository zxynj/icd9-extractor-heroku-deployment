Admission Date:         Discharge Date:Date of Birth:          Sex:  MService:  CCUNOTE:  This is an addendum to Dr.  dictation whichdescribes the presentation, as well as the hospital coursethrough .On , the patient was stable with an improvedcongestive heart failure after his milrinone therapy with acreatinine of 2.4 and a sodium of 129 and the he wascurrently awaiting placement in rehabilitation.  Over thenext three days, his creatinine began to rise and he hadfluid retention, increased peripheral edema and increasedcrackles on exam.  On , it was decided he was notsuitable for rehabilitation placement at that point and wasdecompensating and was thus restarted on milrinone withalmost immediate symptomatic improvement.  On , hiscreatinine was 3.0 and sodium 123.  His weight was 168.8pounds, so he was started on milrinone at 0.28 mcg per kg perminute.Over the next several days, his creatinine began to decreaseand sodium began to increase.  The patient had goodsymptomatic improvement.  On , the rate of milrinonewas increased to 37.5 mcg per kg per minute as he was beingevaluated for potential of home intravenous milrinonetherapy.  Also, on , the patient spiked to a fever to101.9?????? Fahrenheit with 15 white blood cells in hisurinalysis.  He was thus started on a seven day course oforal ciprofloxacin.  The patient defervesced the followingday.  On , his creatinine was down to 1.8 and hissodium was up to 131 and his weight was continuing todecrease, such that on  his weight was 157.3 down 10pounds in less than a week.  Also, on , he hadanother gout flare in his right ankle and was started oncolchicine 0.6 mg q day, as well as a short prednisone taper.During this time, the patient was followed by the heartfailure team to be evaluated for the possibility ofintravenous home milrinone versus intravenous milrinone atrehabilitation facility.  There was no rehabilitationfacilities that could take the patient with intravenousmilrinone and thus the milrinone was stopped on , atwhich time his creatinine was 1.6, his sodium was 136 and hisweight was 154 pounds.  Also, during the milrinone therapy,his carvedilol dose was able to be increased to 4.685 mg ,so he has continued to do well off milrinone and is currentlystable with PICC line placed for potential home milrinonetherapy should he require it.  His insurance companyultimately approved intravenous home milrinone should he needit and he is currently stable and being discharged torehabilitation facility.  In rehabilitation, he will need hisdigoxin level and INR checked 2x per week.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.  Carvedilol 4.685 mg po bid2.  Lisinopril 5 mg po qd3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q od4.

He hada distant history of tobacco use.  He used alcoholoccasionally.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admissionrevealed a tachypneic gentleman in mild respiratory distress.He had a temperature of 98.2??????F, a pulse of 70, a bloodpressure of 113/63, a respiratory rate of 24 and an oxygensaturation of 96% on room air.  On head, eyes, ears, nose andthroat examination, the sclerae were anicteric.  The pupilswere equal, round and reactive to light.  The extraocularmovements were intact.  The oropharynx was clear.  The mucousmembranes were moist.  The neck was supple with no jugularvenous distention or lymphadenopathy.The lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the basesbilaterally.  He had fine rales, left greater than right.The cardiac examination revealed distant heart sounds, but aregular rate and rhythm with a laterally displaced point ofmaximal impulse.  He had a II/VI systolic murmur heard bestat the left lower sternal border radiating out to the axillaand a positive S3.  The abdomen was soft, nontender andnondistended with positive bowel sounds.  He had hepatomegalythree finger-lengths below the rib cage.  The extremityexamination revealed 3+ pitting edema to the thighsbilaterally.LABORATORY DATA:  Significant laboratory data on admissionincluded a white blood cell count of 5000, hematocrit of35.4, platelet count of 122,000, INR of 3.1, partialthromboplastin time of 44.8, sodium of 126, potassium of 4.9,chloride of 85, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 82, creatinine of2.8 and glucose of 112.RADIOLOGY:  The chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly withbilateral left greater than right pleural effusions.ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram wasatrioventricularly paced at a rate of 70 without change fromthe prior electrocardiogram of .HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicalservice with the presumptive diagnosis of worseningcongestive heart failure of unclear etiology.  He was ruledout by cardiac enzymes and had no evidence of acute ischemicheart disease.  He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix on thefloor for several days with good response until hospital day#5, when his creatinine once again began to rise despite theclinical assessment that the patient remained significantlyfluid overloaded.  Laboratory data including a sodium of 119and a potassium of 6.0 with a BUN of 67 and creatinine of 3.1seemed to indicate that the patient was having forwardcardiac failure leading to renal insufficiency andhyponatremia.For this reason, he was transferred to the cardiac care unitfor milrinone treatment guided by pulmonary arterycatheterization measurements.  The heart failure team wasconsulted and helped the cardiology team diurese the patientover the next several days with the titration of milrinone.Over the next several days, the patient diuresedsignificantly, several liters of fluid.  His renal functionimproved to a creatinine of 1.6 and his sodium levelcorrected to a level of 130.  During this time, his Coregmedication had been continued and, after several days at therecommendations of the heart failure team, his Coreg dose wasgradually increased to a level of 6.25 mg b.i.d.  His ACEinhibitor and spironolactone were again added to his regimenand maintained while the milrinone was titrated to off.After weaning of the milrinone and discontinuation of thepulmonary catheterization, the patient was once againtransferred to the cardiology step-down unit, where hisafterload reduction with ACE inhibitors continued to betitrated up and his laboratory data and renal output werefollowed closely.  Although he experienced a slight rise inhis creatinine again after discontinuation of the milrinone,his renal function remained stable with a creatinine of 2.5and he continued to maintain a good urine output withmarkedly improved breathing from admission.During his hospitalization, workup for his heart failure wasconducted.  An echocardiogram revealed no significantdifferences with a continued poor ejection fraction of15-20%.  A TSH level was found to be elevated and so hisSynthroid dose was increased.  He also received a nutritionconsultation and education regarding a low salt cardiac dietto continue on after discharge.Alternative treatments for his heart failure includingDigoxin therapy were entertained, but the decision was madenot to begin Digoxin therapy at this time.  A discussion alsorevolved around maintenance of the patient on 400 mg of dailyamiodarone, given the possible pulmonary toxicity at thisdose and worsening of his subjective shortness of breath.However, given the extensive ectopy in the past on mexiletineand low dose amiodarone, it was felt advisable to continuehim on both mexiletine and higher dose amiodarone.He did experience an exacerbation of his gout, which wastreated with colchicine successfully.DISPOSITION:  On , the patient was markedly improvedfrom a respiratory standpoint and was deemed stable fordischarge to rehabilitation.  He is being actively screenedat this time and can be transferred to rehabilitation uponavailability of a bed.DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:1.  Coronary artery disease.2.  Severe congestive heart failure.3.  Rheumatic heart disease.4.  History of ventricular ectopy.5.  Hypothyroidism.6.  Electrolyte abnormalities.7.  Acute renal failure.FOLLOW UP:  The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation.He will require follow up with the heart failure service inthree to four weeks.  At rehabilitation, it will be importantto continue to monitor his electrolytes, BUN and creatinineas well as his INR level daily.  It will also be important tocheck daily weights before breakfast every day in order tomonitor his fluid status or to monitor intakes and outputs asaccurately as possible.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Zestril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. h.s.Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.Lasix 120 mg p.o. q.d.Mexiletine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.Phenobarbital 120 mg p.o. h.s.Synthroid 0.112 mg p.o. q.d.Imodium 2 mg p.o. after each loose bowel movement p.r.n.                             , M.D.  Dictated By:MEDQUIST36D:    20:59T:    16:14JOB#:   Name:  ,             Unit No:  Admission Date:       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:        Sex:  MService:ADDENDUM:  Discharge Coumadin dose is 2 mg po q h.s. and thepatient is to follow-up with Dr.   in the HeartFailure Clinic on  at 3 p.m.                           , M.D.  Dictated By:MEDQUIST36D:    11:13T:    12:26JOB#:   PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:Indication: Left ventricular function.Known cardiomyopathy.Height: (in) 67Weight (lb): 170BSA (m2): 1.89 m2BP (mm Hg): 130/70Status: InpatientDate/Time:  at 15:50Test: TTE(Complete)Doppler: Complete pulse and color flowContrast: NoneTechnical Quality: AdequateINTERPRETATION:Findings:Pacing wires are present in the right atrium/right ventricle.Pleural effusion is present.LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is markedly dilated.RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is elongated.LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
