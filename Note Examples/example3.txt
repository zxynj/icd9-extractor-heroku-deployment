Cardiac catheterization x2 with thrombectomy and drug eluting stent to the obtuse marginal artery   History of Present Illness: 71 yo male wiht h/o CABG in  , PTCA  , s/p stenting   (unknown anatomy, getting records from the  ), smoking, HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presenting with chest discomfort. The patient reports that the night prior to presentation, he developed left sided chest pain; dullness without any radiation.  No associated diaphoresis, but reports slight nausea and shortness of breath.  The pain was persistent, and did not respond to SL Nitro.  The pain also progressively worsened over the course of the day, prompting the patient to call EMS.  EMS gave to SL NG sprays, with no relief. . The patient does not remember if this chest pain is similar to pain he had in the past prior to his past cardiac events. Denies any worsening exercise tolerance; the patient reports being able to walk about one block before getting short of breath.  Denies any orthopnea, denies PND.  Reports increasing LE swelling; reports that he has never had swelling like this before.  Of note, the patient's wife reports that he has been chest pain free for about one year. . Denies any recent travel, no long plane rides.  Up to date with his cancer screening, as per wife-last colonoscopy 2 years ago, found polyps.  Is not very active at his baseline; does not like walking, does not like going outside. . He had a stress test (due to chest pain) in  , which showed 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia at achieved workload single vessel CAD-new regional dysfunction with distal inferior hypokinesis. LVEF >55% . On ROS, the patient denies any recent fevers/chills, no blood in stools, no changes in bowel movements, no urinary symptoms. Denies any lightheadedness or dizziness. . In the ED, the patient's initial vitals: 97.8 64 138/79 16 95% RA.  He was initially given 1 L of fluid and treated for COPD excacerbation with azithromycin, prednisone, and nebulizers.  He then developed respiratory distress and required NRB.  Repeat CXR showed ? worsening pulmonary edema and patient was given 20 mg IV lasix.  EKG unchanged from priors, found to have elevated troponin and started on IV heparin, given ASA.  Received 8 mg morphine, 1 mg Dilaudid and now chest pain free.  Past Medical History: 1.

MICRO/PATH: . MRSA SCREEN (Final  ):    No MRSA isolated. . IMAGING/STUDIES: . TTE  : The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ( +) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Trace aortic regurgitation. . CXR PA/LAT  : IMPRESSION: Emphysema with superimposed pulmonary edema. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. . C.CATH  : FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Thrombus in the vein graft to OM. 3. Small hematoma at arterial puncture site. . C.CATH  : FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Success PCI to the 95% SVG to OM lesion with Promus DES. 2. Patient to remain on aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel for at least 1 year uninterrupted. 3. No complications.  Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with h/o CABG in  , PTCA  , s/p stenting  , smoking, HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presented with chest pain and was found to have NSTEMI and acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. . ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: . # NSTEMI: Mr.   was admitted to the CCU with a chief complaint of chest pain without ST elevations on EKG and a significant coronary history including CABG followed by PTCA and stenting. Cardiac catheterization showed proximal occlusion of SVG to OM and thrombus. On initial catheterization, no intervention was attmepted because the interventional team was not able to protect distal to thrombus for emboli. However, repeat catheterization was successful with deployment of DES to the 95% occluded SVG to OM lesion. The patient was started on aspirin 325mg daily and will need to continue taking this indefinitely, as well as plavix which he will need for at least 1 year uninterrupted. He was continued on his home carvedilol and atorvastatin as well. Follow-up appointments were arranged for him prior to discharge. . # Acute Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation: Mr.   was without history of CHF but was hypoxic of NRB on arrival to CCU with prominent rales on exam, CXR c/w with pulmonary edema, and peripheral edema. The etiology of his CHF was thought to be related to his acute MI exacerbated by administration of 1LNS in the ED. He was diuresed aggressively until he reached euvolemia clinically and was able to sat in the high 90's on room air. TTE showed LVEF of >55%. He was counseled on maintaining a low sodium diet as well as taking daily weights to monitor his fluid balance. He was continued on carvedilol at the time of discharge. . # Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: His creatinine on admission was 1.3 (up from baseline of 1.1). This was likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of MI and diastolic CHF. His Cr returned to baseline with diuresis in spite of contrast loads from two C.Caths.  # COPD:  Pt does not have dx of COPD, but with flattened diaphragms and parenchymal findings on CXR consistent with COPD in the context of extensive smoking history. He was given prednisone/azithromycin in ED for concern of COPD exacerbation that was later felt to be consistent with CHF exacerbation. He will likely benefit from formal PFT's as an outpatient and continued smoking cessation counseling. . CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: . # Hypertension: Stable. Patient takes Carvedilol, nifedipine, and Hydrochlorothiazide as an outpatient. He was continued on carvedilol which was decreased from TID to   dosing and his home nifedipine and HCTZ were discontinued. His blood pressure should be re-visited in the outpatient setting. . # Hyperlipidemia: Stable with TC of 137 and LDL of 68. His home atorvastatin was increased to 80mg PO daily. . # Diabetes: HbA1c 6.8%. On Glyburide-Metformin as an outpatient. Was managed with HISS in house and discharged on his home PO regimen. . # BPH: Stable. Continued on doxazosin at the time of discharge. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # He will likely benefit from formal PFT's and continued smoking cessation. . # Changes were made to his anti-hypertensive regimen and this issue should be revisited during an outpatient visit.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Acute on Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure  Secondary diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr.  , . It was a pleasure taking part in your medical care while you were in the hospital. You had chest pain and a cardiac catheterization that showed a large clot in one of the heart arteries. You required another catheterization to remove the clot safely and a drug eluting stent was placed to keep the artery open. It is extremely important that you take plavix every day to prevent the stent from closing off and causing another heart attack. Do not stop taking plavix or miss    s unless Dr.   tells you it is OK. . Your blood pressure was a little low while you were in the hospital so we made some changes to your blood pressure medicines. If your blood pressure goes back up yuor doctor may want to restart some of these medicines. . You had some fluid in your lungs that was removed with intravenous medicines. We did not continue these medications. You will need to weigh yourself every morning, call Dr.   if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. . The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1. INCREASE Atorvastatin to 80 mg daily to help your heart recover from a heart attack. 2. INCREASE aspirin to 325 mg daily to prevent the stent from clotting off 3. DECREASE carvedilol to 6.25 mg twice a day 3. STOP taking nifedipine and hydrochlorothiazide 4. START taking nitroglycerin only as needed for chest pain at home. Take one tablet, then wait 5 minutes, then take one more tablet if you still have the pain. Call 911 for any chest pain that is still there after 2 nitroglycerin tablets.
