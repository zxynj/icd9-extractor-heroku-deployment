ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr.   is a 71-year-old male with progressively enlarged juxta-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm who had been followed by Dr.     on the vascular surgery service for about a year and a half. His abdominal aneurysm had been slowly enlarging and therefore it was decided that he would need to undergo elective repair. His operative planning was complicated by the presence of a large parastomal hernia at the site of his left end colostomy. The plan was for him to undergo an aneurysm via a right retroperitoneal approach. Preoperatively the patient was noted to have symptomatic coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 months before the planned surgery. He was given several months to recover from this and presented for an elective repair of an aneurysm on  .  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented electively as noted on  , and underwent a repair of his juxta- renal abdominal aortic aneurysm using a right retroperitoneal approach with an 18 mm tube graft. Intraoperatively the anatomy of the aneurysm required placement of the aortic cross clamp above the renal arteries. In addition significant thrombus was idenytified and removed form the aortic segment. Otherwise there was no noted significant intraoperative complication, but he did not make very much urine during the case. He was brought intubated to the cardiovascular intensive care unit postoperatively and his course was initially noted for minimal urine output of approximately 5 cc per hour. The nephrology service was consulted and followed along making management recommendations, but this was a possible anticipated outcome given the position of the aortic cross clamp. The patient was aggressively hydrated and resuscitated on the evening of postoperative day 0. He remained hemodynamically normal but required continued ventilatory supports. Early on the morning of postoperative day 1 the patient was noted to have increasing IV fluid requirements with a rising base deficit and a progressively rising lactic acidosis. His pulses were noted to be diminished in his lower extremities and there was a small degree of mottling along his thigh. Given that the aorta was quite calcified intraoperatively there was concern that he may have dislodged some debris and embolized distally into his mesenteric circulation or his lower extremities. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation was continued and intravenous antibiotics were started over a concern for possible mesenteric ischemia. The patient's creatinine kinase continued to rise, raising concern for ischemia to the lower extremities. The general surgery service was consulted for evaluation for the possible mesenteric ischemia. After fluid resuscitation as there was no significant improvement, the patient was taken urgently back to the operating room and at that time was found to have thrombosis in his distal aorta proximal to bifurcation of the iliac. The massive fluid resuscitation had caused a significant degree of edema in the abdomen, and the general surgery service performed a decompressive laparotomy for the presence of abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient was transferred back to the cardiovascular intensive care unit after his decompressive laparotomy, his aortic thrombectomy, revision of his repair, and restoration of flow to his lower extremities. It was noted that he had likely showered emboli to his gluteal arteries for which he was heparinized. He continued to remain critically ill and developed progressively increasing requirements for ventilatory support with significant pulmonary edema postoperatively. His renal function continued to deteriorate and continuous  -  hemodialysis was started in conjunction with nephrology consultation. The cardiology and electrophysiology services were following for recommendations regarding his pacemaker. By postoperative day 2 the patient continued to remain critically ill. He was requiring high dose vasopressors including continuous epinephrine infusion, norepinephrine infusion, and vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. Given his multi-system organ failure which had developed by postoperative day 2, a family meeting was held with the daughter and the decision was made to withdraw care on the morning of postoperative day 3 if no significant change occurred overnight. Late in the evening of postoperative day 2 the patient went into a V-tach arrest. Advanced cardiac life support was initiated and the patient was resuscitated and regained a perfusing rhythm. Several hours later, early on the morning of postoperative 3, the patient again went into a V-tach arrest for which advanced cardiac life support was again reinitiated. This progressed into episodes of asystole. CPR and ACLS were continued for approximately 60 minutes without maintainable restoration of his perfusing rhythm. As we were unable to resuscitate the patient at this time, he was pronounced dead at 12:42 a.m. on  , postoperative day 3. The coroner declined to perform an autopsy. The family declined an autopsy. The   Organ Bank was notified for protocol.                               , M.D.    Dictated By:  MEDQUIST36 D:    19:43:49 T:    11:47:14 Job#:     PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Abnormal ECG. Atrial fibrillation. Coronary artery disease. H/O cardiac surgery. Hypertension. Left ventricular function. Status: Inpatient Date/Time:   at 09:15 Test: Portable TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Technical Quality: Adequate   INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  71 year old presented for suprarenal aortic aneurysm repair. Limited transgastric views. Mild TR with pulomonay artery systolic pressure of 35mm of Hg. Trace MR. Asynchronous movement of the interventricular septum. Vp 44.5cm/sec preclamp. Vp decreased to 20cm/sec after the suprerenal clamp. After the clamp came off Vp back to the base line. MPI is LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA.  LEFT VENTRICLE: Low normal LVEF. Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w normal LV diastolic function.  LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.  Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is   dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are    .      12:51 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip #    Reason: assess for pneumothorax  Admitting Diagnosis: ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM/SDA  ______________________________________________________________________________    MEDICAL CONDITION:    71 year old man with infrarenal AAA s/p open repair   REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:   assess for pneumothorax  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  AP CHEST, 1:25 A.M.,     HISTORY:  Infrarenal triple AAA repair.  Possible pneumothorax.   IMPRESSION:  AP supine chest compared to  :   The lung bases are excluded from the study.  Disparity in radiodensity of the  upper lungs is due largely to moderate left pleural effusion and severe  emphysema.  An upright view of the entire chest would of course be more  reliable in excluding pneumothorax.  Tip of the ET tube at the upper margin of  the clavicles is at least 9 cm from the carina, 4 cm above optimum placement.  Right atrial and ventricular pacer and defibrillator leads are not fully  imaged.  A left ventricular lead is unchanged in its position since at least   .   Mild edema is probably present in the left lung, though overlying pleural  effusion can simulate edema.      2:55 PM  CHEST PORT.

FINDINGS: Comparison with the study of  , there are midline sternal  sutures with the cardiac pacing device remaining in place. ETT lies  approximately 5 cm above the carina at the mid clavicular level. Right  internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the proximal right pulmonary  artery.   There is opacification at the left base with meniscus formation consistent  with a large pleural effusion. It is difficult to evaluate the status of the  underlying lung.   There is some prominence of interstitial markings on the left especially,  suggesting some overhydration or vascular congestion.   IMPRESSION: Post surgical appearance with ETT and Swan-Ganz catheter in place.  Large left pleural effusion. Possibility of some overhydration.
