HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY:  This had resolved and the patientwas continued on his Labetalol, Clonidine, Lisinopril andNorvasc.  His dosages were adjusted to keep his bloodpressure under control.  Telemetry was discontinued when hearrived on the floor.2.  NAUSEA AND VOMITING, GASTROPARESIS AND COFFEE GROUNDS:This too had resolved, and the patient was continued onAtivan, Reglan, Zofran and intravenous fluids p.r.n.  Thepatient was followed by Gastrointestinal who had nothing toadd.3.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was continued on hisRegular insulin sliding scale, his fixed insulin and fourtimes a day fingersticks.  He continued to be followed by the.  He was kept on an American Diabetic Associationdiet.4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  This improved as well withintravenous fluids.  His electrolytes were continued to bechecked and any abnormalities were treated with eitherrepletion of other treatment.5.  AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION:  This was noted to be possiblecause of his hypo and hypertension.  For this reason thesuggestion was made to have the patient follow-up with theAutonomic  Clinic.6.  DEPRESSION:  This was stable.7.  ACCESS:  The patient's femoral line was discontinued onthe day of discharge.8.  UMBILICAL MASS:  The patient was noted to have a smalldefect at the umbilicus.  It was thought to be a urachal cystgiven findings on CT scan.  A Urology consultation wasrequested as well as a surgical consultation.  The decisionwas made to prescribe the patient an abdominal binder and tohave him follow-up as an outpatient.Based on the patient's stable clinical status and the factthat he was taking p.o. and his sugars were under control andso were his blood pressures the decision was made todischarge the patient with appropriate follow-up.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home with Services.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:1.

INDICATION:  Patient with diabetes and severe gastroparesis.  The patient has a ventral hernia.  The request is to do a CT cystogram to assess for communication between bladder and umbilical hernia. TECHNIQUE:  Helical contiguous axial images were obtained at the level of the umbilicus in the supine and right decubitus positions.  500 cc of diluted contrast material was infused into the urinary bladder. COMPARISON:  Previous examination from . LIMITED STUDY OF THE PELVIS WITH NO IV CONTRAST. After infusion of 500 cc of diluted contrast material, the urinary bladder is big and reaching the area of the umbilicus.  No connection is noticed between the urinary bladder and the umbilicus.  There is a fluid-filled, well- demarcated area within an area of ventral hernia near the umbilicus. No connection is noticed between this area and the bowel. This finding is consistent with a hernia with an urachal cyst.  There are no signs of wall thickening or fat stranding around it. IMPRESSION:  Ventral hernia which contains urachal cyst.  There is no connection between the hernia and the  or the urinary bladder.  10:04 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip #  Reason: assess for congestive heart failure ______________________________________________________________________________  MEDICAL CONDITION:     33 year old man with dm, gastroparesis, cad, comes with hypertension.
