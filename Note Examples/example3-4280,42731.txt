PLEASE EVAL PLACEMENT of new   RIGHT IJ.  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of new right internal jugular line  placement.   Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no benefit of comparison to the  previous studies.  The right internal jugular line tip is in mid SVC.  No  apical pneumothorax is identified but the right costophrenic angle is excluded  from the field of view.  Thus there is no possibility for total exclusion of  pneumothorax based on the current chest radiograph.  The heart size is mildly  enlarged.  The patient has had CABG.  There is left lower lobe consolidation  which could represent atelectasis secondary to moderate left pleural effusion  but infectious process cannot be excluded.  The moderate left pleural effusion  is partially layering obscuring the left lung.  The patient is in mild volume  overload.  The left-sided pacemaker is inserted with its leads terminating in  right atrium and right ventricle.  An additional abandoned pacemaker lead is  present also terminating in right ventricle.  It is unclear if it is connected  or disconnected to the pacemaker.  For _____ of this finding AP and lateral  view are recommended.      nsg note: 20:00-7:00 this is an 89 y.o. man adm   from     with hx cad, s/p cabg, chf (lv ef 40% mod. mr/as), recurrent pna with hx of l partial pneumonectomy for unclear reasons. trans. from     for management of pna/resp insuff. /apnea/pulselessness-cpr x1 min. for approx past month. pt c/o weakness/fatigue, mult falls, dx with pna via cxr.   received ivabx, adm       s/p fall, head ct negative. dc dx syncope. in ed at  , a rij placed, insulin given for hyperglycemia, no bed in icu-transferred to    . pt hypotensive to the 60s systolic on dopamine and was switched to levophed in route with sbp remaining in the 60s on arrival. levophed remains at max dose of .3mcg/kg/min. pt has also received total of 1250cc ns from   and 750cc cc ns here overnight for poor oliguria-12cc. other sig. findings are hypothermia on arrival, agitation, elevated lactate of 6.  neuro: arousing to voice, yelling out intermittently c/o pain when any of his ext. are touched as he has mult skin tears, also c/o intermittent bladder pain. unable to assess pupils d/t pt uncooperative. pt at times found to attempt to pull at foley and reminded not to. a&ox2, not to full date. mae but weak. refusing morphine for discomfort screaming that he doesn't have any pain up until 3am. bladder spasms unrelieved with viscous lidocaine. .5mg iv morphine given without much effect. pyridium given and awaiting effect. tmax 97.9ax-was given bair hugger on arrival when ext cool and temp 95ax.  cv: hr 80 vpaced, no ectopy. bp very labile ranging from as low as the 40s to as high as the 180s. when levophed is weaned down even slightly, pt becomes hypotensive and requires max gtt dose resumed. currenty levophed at .3mcg/kg/min. +troponin leak. on asa qd, inr elevated at 2.0, am level 2.2, no heparin sc prophylactically. +pp via doppler.  resp: lungs cta in upper lung fields, crackles at the bases, sp02 ranging mid 80s to as high as 100%. 02 sat will rise up to 90s with coughing, nonproductive.  gi/gu: abd soft, nt, nd, +bs, loose brown ob negative bm in small/moderate amts x2. foley irrigated with +return of yellow urine but only got back what was flushed. viscous lidocaine given x3 without much effect. bladder scan revealed only 36cc urine. pyridium given po without effect thus far. pt able to swallow pill ok with water drunk from a straw sitting upright.  skin: mult skin tears all over ext. l elbow abrasion with red base, serous moderate drainage-abd, 4x4s, softsorb applied. ll leg abrasion red with serous scant drainage-nonadhering dsg applied. l hand with dsg intact-pt refusing adamently for it to be looked at and changed. r heel abrasion red with adaptic applied.  lines: rt w #18g and rla #22g patent, rij tlcl patent.  endo: fs 70 on arrival and was given 1 amp d50. k was 5.6 and pt was given 4 units reg. insulin followed by 1 amp d50 with stable bs x4hrs after that.   stim test performed and results pending.  social: dtr.     is    nsg note: 20:00-7:00 (Continued)  his hcp and made pt dnr/dni on arrival after speaking with md team. dtr. updated on pt's condition and was with pt at bedside up until 5:30am. she will be by later today to see pt.  plan: continue to monitor mental status, ivabx, temp, lytes,   stim results, micro data, skin consult- ? needs special bed. remains dnr/dni, family aware of possibility of making comfort care if condition worsens. monitor level of comfort esp penile area where catheter is- may need more morphine, ? another dose of pyridium if pain still continues, ? pt as uti, awaiting cx. monitor u.o, may need more fluid boluses, monitor lactate level.
