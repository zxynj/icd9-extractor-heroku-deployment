In brief, this is an 81yo man w/ systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 45%, dry weight 215lbs in  ), HTN, Afib on coumadin and vascular dementia, admitted for altered mental status, this morning being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia. . He was last well about 10 days ago when he initially had urinary retention c/b UTI and altered mental status. He improved quickly with antibiotics and went to rehab on PO antibiotics.   he had low BPs and altered mental status. CXR showed PNA, and he was started on ceftriaxone/azithro with improvement. Yesterday morning he was again altered, could not get out of bed, and was transferred to the  . . In the ED he triggered for hypoxia that improved with 6L O2 by NC. Given vanc/levo/flagyl. Trop 0.08 and BNP >9000. Given ASA, but not Lasix because of concern for infection/sepsis. On the floor overnight he was appearing improved and was given lasix 20mg IV x1. He had an unwitnessed fall early this morning and was found on the ground. At 7am he was again hypoxic with an arterial P02 59 on a non-rebreather. He is profoundly confused, oriented x0 and having trouble speaking. . Speaking with his wife, he usually lives in   with her, is oriented x3, walks with a walker, and had been hospitalized very little before the last 3 weeks. He had never been hospitalized before 3 weeks ago. He is DNR/DNI, but she would like him to get all of the care necessary to improve his current status short of intubation.

SPARSE GROWTH.       YEAST.    MODERATE GROWTH.  SECOND MORPHOLOGY.  CXR Portable  : FINDINGS: Lung volumes are profoundly diminished. The patient was imaged in a somewhat lordotic position. There is diffuse interstitial opacity with cephalad flow most consistent with volume overload likely due to congestive heart failure. Aortic tortuosity is present with calcified plaque seen at the arch. The cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess but is enlarged.  There is right pleural effusion with fluid tracking within the minor and major fissures. A left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded. There is poor visualization of the retrocardiac lung, possibly due to atelectasis and/or edema. No pneumothorax is noted. The bones are diffusely osteopenic with degenerative changes noted in both shoulder joints. IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with congestive heart failure. Correlate clinically. Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.  CT HEAD NON-CONTRAST  : FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction is present. There is no shift of normally midline structures and  -white matter differentiation appears well preserved.  There is prominence of the ventricles and the sulci compatible with parenchymal atrophy. There are periventricular white matter hypodensities compatible with small vessel microvascular disease. However, no acute infarcts are present. Osseous structures appear intact and the visualized sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Parenchymal atrophy and small vessel microvascular disease but no acute intracranial findings.  SWALLOWING VIDEO FLUOROSCOPY  : Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow department. Multiple consistencies of barium were administered.  There was aspiration and penetration to thin liquids.  ECG,  : The underlying rhythm is probably atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Intraventricular conduction defect. One ventricular premature beat is seen. Lateral ST-T wave changes likely due to left ventricular hypertrophy. Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison. Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 81  /464 134 -40 118  ECG,  : Atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular premature beats.  Intraventricular conduction delay. Left axis deviation. Late transition. Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 76 0 150 446/474 0 -41 134  Brief Hospital Course: 81 year-old man w/ systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 45%, dry weight 215 lbs. in  ), HTN, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and vascular dementia, admitted for altered mental status, transferred to the MICU for altered mental status and hypoxia. . # Hypoxia: Most likely due to combination of acute decompensation of his CHF in the setting of diastolic dysfunction secondary to afib with RVR, as well as healthcare acquired pneumonia.   HCAP: Patient completed a 8-day course of cefepime/vancomycin and was afebrile with normal WBC on discharge. Acute on chronic CHF: He received several doses of 40 IV Lasix. Subsequently, his exam appeared more dry so lasix was held. On discharge, he weighed 185 lbs and was 93-96% on RA. He will require daily standing weights, ins/outs monitoroing, volume assessment, and every other day (until stabilized) electrolytes monitoring. He can be restarted on his home dose of furosemide 40 mg daily for a goal of maintaining euvolemia. . # Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Patient is extremely sensitive to metabolic insult, and has had wide fluctuations in his mental status with his recent infections and CHF exacerbation. CT head w/o contrast did not show acute process. Scopolamine patch was apparently given at rehab facility, and also likely contributed; this was discontinued. When he was able to take POs, home doses of Donepezil and Memantine were restarted. . # Afib on coumadin: Coumadin initially held for supertherapeutic INR (3.5).  He was started on IV Metoprolol as he was unable to take POs.  He was then transitioned to PO metoprolol (increased from 12.5 mg   to 25 mg  ), and his heart rate remained well-controlled. His Coumadin was re-started at home dose of 2.5 mg, then increased to 3 mg on  ; INR at discharge is 1.6. INR will need to be checked on   and thereafter as needed for goal of INR  . . # Urinary Retention: Patient underwent Foley catheter placement after repeatedly failing voiding trials. Etiologies include BPH vs recent scopolamine patch.  He underwent and failed a repeat voiding trial with PVR 700  , and underwent TID straight catheterization thereafter. He was continued on Flomax with up-titrated dose (0.8 mg). As straight catheterization not available at rehab, a foley catheter was placed prior to transfer and will remain in place until follow-up with Dr.   in Urology on  . . #) Acute renal failure: His creatinine trended up from a baseline of 1.0 to 1.6 in the setting of aggressive diuresis. FeNa of 0.45% was consistent with pre-renal intravascular depletion. He was hydrated with gentle IVF. ACE inhibitor and furosemide were held and medications renally dosed. Creatinine was stable (1.6) at time of discharge, up from baseline of 1.0. His ACE-I may be restarted as outpatient when his creatinine returns to baseline. His renal function should be monitored at the rehab every other day as needed until improved. . #) Nutrition: Due to suspicion of aspiration, the patient was evaluated by speech and swallow and underwent a video swallowing study that showed evidence of aspiration with thin liquids. He was started on a Pureed (dysphagia) diet with Nectar prethickened liquids, which he tolerated. His medications were crushed.  \\ . # S/p fall: patient found down   on the floor. Not complaining of focal pain, but he has difficulty cooperating fully with a neurologic exam.  He does open eyes to command and squeeze fingers when asked. CT head without acute ICH. . #) Hyperlipidemia:  Patient was continued on home dose of 5mg simvastatin when able to tolerate POs. . #) Gout: Allopurinol renally dosed. Can increase to usual 400 mg daily as renal function improves. . #) Outpatient management: Once admitted to rehab, the patient needs every other day blood labs to monitor serum electrolytes, creatinine, INR, and daily weights.  Plan to monitor volum status clinically to reach a balance between his CHF and renal failure. Outpatient urology follow-up as above.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility:   in    Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Heart failure exacerbation with acute renal insufficiency Healthcare-associated pneumonia  Secondary diagnosis: Chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). Mental Status: Confused - sometimes. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. O2 saturation: 93-95% on RA at rest.   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to   with altered mental status and shortness of breath. You were found to have a pneumonia and too much fluid in your lungs (heart failure exacerbation). You were given antibiotics for 8 days for the pneumonia, as well as medication to help remove the extra fluid. Your symptoms improved and you were discharged to a rehab facility. We also monitored you for worsened kidney function; this was stable on discharge.  In the setting of your acute illness, there was concern for your ability to swallow liquids/food without aspirating. You were evaluted by the swallowing team and underwent a swallowing study. You aren't able to swallow well when you drink thin liquids (water), so you will need to continue to crush your pills and stay on a puree diet.  We made the following changes to your home medications: 1. We increased Tamsulosin (Flomax) to 0.8 mg instead of 0.4 mg 2. We increased Metoprolol to 25 mg twice daily instad of 12.5 mg twice daily 3. We have held your furosemide (Lasix) for now; this can be restarted as needed at your rehab. 4. We decreased your allopurinol to 150 mg daily instead of 400 mg daily until your kidney function improves 5. We stopped your scopalamine patch  Followup Instructions: Urology Follow-Up Name:  ,       Location: UROLOGY PRACTICE ASSOCIATES Address:  ,  ,  Phone:   When: Tuesday,  :30AM  Neurology Follow-Up: Provider:    , MD Phone:  Date/Time:  1:00                                    MD     Atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular premature beats.

COMPARISON:   .   PORTABLE CHEST:   Lung volumes remain low, and there is resultant bibasilar atelectasis, likely  accounting for dense retrocardiac opacity.  There is no focal consolidation to  convincingly suggest pneumonia, there is no pneumothorax.  Small amount of  pleural fluid is seen on the right, and there is likely a small left pleural  effusion present as well.  Heart remains enlarged, and there is persistent  engorgement of the pulmonary vessels with pulmonary edema.  This appears  little changed from  .  The aortic knob is calcified.  There is  minimal leftward deviation of the trachea at the level of thoracic inlet,  suggesting possible thyroid enlargement on the right, which can be further  evaluated by ultrasound.   IMPRESSION:   Persistent cardiomegaly, small right and likely left pleural effusions,  central vascular congestion and edema, little changed from  , all  again compatible with congestive heart failure. No convincing evidence of  pneumonia.   Possible right thyroid enlargement, which can be further evaluated by  ultrasound as clinically indicated.     7:14 AM  CHEST PORT.

FINDINGS:  No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular  territorial infarction is present.  There is no shift of normally midline  structures and  -white matter differentiation appears well preserved.  There is prominence of the ventricles and the sulci compatible with  parenchymal atrophy.  There are periventricular white matter hypodensities  compatible with small vessel microvascular disease.  However, no acute  infarcts are present.  Osseous structures appear intact and the visualized  sinuses are clear.   IMPRESSION:   1.  Parenchymal atrophy and small vessel microvascular disease but no acute  intracranial findings.
