The patient was under general anesthesia throughout theprocedure.Conclusions:PREBYPASSNo atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wallthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolicfunction is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wallmotion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation isseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitralregurgitation is seen.POSTBYPASSPreserved biventicular systolic function. Study is otherwise unchanged fromprebypass. Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of  there is newST segment elevation in leads II, III and aVF with early precordial R waveprogression. These changes together, are consistent with prior true posteriormyocardial infarction and ongoing inferior ischemia. Followup and clinicalcorrelation are suggested.  1:00 PM CHEST PORT.
