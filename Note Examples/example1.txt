The patient was seen by the toxicologyservice, who recommended supportive care and careful monitoring,which was completed in the intensive care unit initially. He wasstable and transfered to the general medical floor. When thepatient became more alert, he was seen by psychiatry, to whomthe patient denied any purposeful suicide attempts, but admittedto increased stressors in his life, including recently losinghis job. The patient was unable to provide explanation for why arecently filled prescription bottle of tramadol was foundcompletely empty nearby, when he was found unresponsive.Psychiatry thought that the patient needed further inpatientevaluation in a dual diagnosis unit. He was kept on a section12, due to potential risk of acute harm to self. Gabapentin andother CNS depressant medications were withheld initially. Thepatient had a 1:1 sitter assigned to his bed throughout thehospitalization. He should have TSH, B12, and folate checked onan outpatient basis at PCP . Attempts were made tocontact his outpatient providers.# Back pain: The patient has a history of vertebral surgeriesand reported recently re-injuring his back. Toxicology clearedhim to restart taking baclofen for this pain, and he was writtenfor his reported home dose. His gabapentin was restarted at 300mg TID, and may be titrated up to his home dose of 600 mg TID astolerated with carefully monitoring during his inpatientpsychiatric stay.# Hypertension: The patient reportedly takes lisinopril dailyfor hypertension, but was normotensive upon arrival to themedical floor. Anti-hypertensive therapy was withheld initially,and then resumed after he remained hemodynamically stable.# Diabetes, Type 2: The patient was treated with a regularinsulin sliding scale initially, and then his oral medicationswere resumed.# Restless leg syndrome: He is on sinemet, gabapentin, andtopiramate for his restless leg syndrome, which may be resumed.# Tobacco dependence: The patient was written for a nicotinepatch.# Thrombocytopenia: Mild, noted during patient\'s stay. This hasalso been observed in the past. He was low probablity for HIT,so testing not sent. No evidence of bleeding or disorders. Itwas also observed that he had platelet clumping. When hisplatelets were colleted in a yellow-speckled top and blue top,his platelet count was normal at 233,000.# History of Crohn\'s disease, Migraines: Not active issuesduring his stay.# Leukocytosis: Noted in system dating back for many years. Perdiscussion with his outpatient providers, he has had a negativeinfectious work-up in . No signs of infection atpresent.Medications on Admission:Baclofen 20 mg PO TID-last filled Sinemet 10/100 PO TID-for restless leg syndrome, last filledGabapentin 600 mg PO TID - for low back painLisinopril 20 mg PO dailyMetformin 500 mg PO BIDPioglitazone 30 mg PO dailyTopiramate 25 mg PO BID - for restless leg syndrome, last filledTramadol 50 mg PO Q6 hrs PRN - per PCP,  taking 100mg TID,last filled Discharge Medications:1.
