Had associated shortness of breath and flushing.  It was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  She denied any nausea, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis.  She also reported a history of severe fatigue over a period of several months.  Stress test in   showed no defects with an EF of 66 percent.  In the Emergency Room, she was found to have EKG changes with ST depression in V4 through V6, I and aVL. Cardiac enzymes are elevated with CK's 245 to 658, MB 9 to 64 and troponin up to 1.87.  She was stable throughout the evening of admission.  Was taken to the Cath Lab on   with findings of a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45 percent, anterior hypokinesis, left main disease 95 percent distally, LAD diffuse disease, left circ mild disease, and RCA 60 percent proximal.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  Cardiac Surgery consult was obtained at that time, and the patient was taken emergently to the operating room on Friday evening,   for a coronary artery bypass grafting with Dr.    .  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 98.3, heart rate 74 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 150/49, respiratory rate 24, SPO2 97 percent on 2 liters.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room on the evening of   for CABG x2 with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM- 1.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass time of 47 minutes.  Cross- clamp time of 37 minutes.  Overall course was uneventful and the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in a normal sinus rhythm rate of 91, mean arterial pressure of 82, CVP of 10.  Neo-Synephrine drip of 0.3 and a propofol drip of 10.  Propofol and vent were weaned, and she was extubated early afternoon on  .  Her balloon pump was also weaned to 1 to 3 and subsequently removed with no complications.  On postoperative day two was also significant for the removal of her chest tubes, weaning of her Neo-Synephrine, and discontinuation of her Swan-Ganz catheter.  On postoperative day three, the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery floor   2, where she continued to recover prior to her discharge.  Postoperative day four was also uneventful with only discontinuation of her pacing wires and increasing her physical activity.  Postoperative day five also brought no changes and increase in physical activity.  The patient was found to be unable to return home needing further physical therapy and she was screened for rehab.  She was accepted at the   in  , and will be discharged today or tomorrow morning.  On postoperative day four, due to a hematocrit of 23, patient was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells with improvement in her hematocrit.

The Swan-Ganz  catheter remains with its tip coiled in the left pulmonary artery. The  endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, with its tip at the level of the  thoracic inlet. The NG tube is noted with its tip and sidehole within the  stomach.   There has been further reduction in lung volumes. There is ongoing pulmonary  edema without significant change, allowing for the low lung volumes.  Mediastinal and pleural drains are again noted.   IMPRESSION: Further reduction in lung volumes with ongoing pulmonary edema.

The patient is s/p interval cardiac surgery with median sternotomy and  mediastinal and bilateral pleural drains.  There has been interval placement  of an endotracheal tube with its tip 2.5 cm above the carina.  A Swan Ganz  catheter has been introduced from the right side with its tip coiled in the  left pulmonary artery.  There is an enteric tube with its tip and sidehole in  the stomach.   There has been interval worsening of congestive heart failure.  The cardiac  silhouette is unchanged in size.  There is no pneumothorax.   IMPRESSION: 1. Interval cardiac surgery.  The Swan Ganz catheter is coiled  within the left pulmonary artery.  This finding was called to Dr.      at the time of interpretation.   2.Worsening congestive heart failure.      8:39 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip #    Reason: SOB, please eval  Admitting Diagnosis: R/O MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION-CHEST PAIN  ______________________________________________________________________________    MEDICAL CONDITION:      68 year old woman with CAD s/p CABG.

COMPARISON:  .   FINDINGS: Single portable AP view of the chest shows a moderate left pleural  effusion. There is increased density and almost complete opacification of the  inferior portion of the left upper lobe; air bronchograms are seen. Its well  demarcated appearance suggests a post obstructive process, although a lobar  pneumonia can also be seen. There is increased atelectasis of the right middle  lung zone. A right sided PICC line terminates in the right atrium and should  be withdrawn a couple of cm. Midline sternotomy wires and skin staples  indicate recent CABG.   IMPRESSION: Left upper lobe opacification, consistent with pneumonia or post  obstructive process such as mucous plugging. Persistent left pleural effusion.  Right perihilar density suggesting atelectasis. Right sided central venous  line with tip in right atrium.     8:31 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)                                                Clip #    Reason: s/p cabg, r/o inf  Admitting Diagnosis: R/O MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION-CHEST PAIN  ______________________________________________________________________________    MEDICAL CONDITION:    68 year old woman with chest pain   REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:   s/p cabg, r/o inf  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  INDICATION:   Chest pain after CABG.

There is also  a probable small right pleural effusion and right middle lobe atelectasis.  There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube and  bilateral chest tubes.  A right sided IJ central venous line is again seen.  Midline sternotomy wires, skin staples and staples over the left heart border  indicate recent CABG.

The endotracheal  tube is again noted with its tip at the level of the thoracic inlet. The Swan-  Ganz catheter is stable in its position, with its tip coiled in the left  pulmonary artery. The NG tube is again noted with its tip and sidehole within  the stomach. Pleural and mediastinal drains are stable in their position. An  intraaortic balloon pump is in place. Its radiopaque marker  is 8 cm inferior  to the most superior aspect of the aortic arch. This finding was conveyed to  Dr.     at the time of interpretation.   There is improved aeration within the lungs. There is however, a new  nonspecific density at the left base with silhouetting of the left hemi-  diaphragm. This may be a result of left atelectasis or pleural effusion.  Pneumonia however is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax.   IMPRESSION: 1. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip remains coiled within the left  pulmonary artery.   2. The radiopaque marker of the intraaortic balloon pump is approximately 8 cm  inferior to the aortic arch. Both of the above findings were conveyed to Dr.    at the time of interpretation.   3.
