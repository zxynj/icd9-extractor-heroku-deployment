EXAMINATION:  Noncontrast head CT. COMPARISONS:  Comparison to noncontrast head CT from  and . TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was administered. FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left temporoparietal craniotomy.  There appears to have been an interval increase in size of left temporal epidural hematoma, which now measures 23 mm in its greatest transverse diameter that is increased from 17 mm from prior study from . However, changes  in location of the sections with respect to the hematoma make comparison of size unreliable. There are other focal areas of hemorrhage located in the right temporal lobe and in the right frontal lobe that are unchanged in size and appearance. There is mild hypoattenuation surrounding the right frontal area of hemorrhage that represents surrounding edema.  There are no new areas of edema or hemorrhage. There is no evidence of masses or evidence for infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.  There is slight improvement of the diffuse paranasal sinus opacification. There is an unchanged nondisplaced fracture that extends through the squamous portion of the left temporal bone. IMPRESSION: 1.  Possible interval increase in size of left temporal epidural hemorrhage from 17 mm on study from  in transverse diameter canal 23 mm.  This may be due to slice selection artifacts; however, this may be due to slice selection. There is no worsening of mass effect with stable appearance, left uncal herniation and subfalcine herniation. 2.

COMPARISONS:  CT  at 12:46 p.m. TECHNIQUE:  5-mm axial contiguous images of the head were obtained. FINDINGS:  The patient is status post partial evacuation of left temporal epidural hematoma.  Residual extra-axial hyperdense collection within the left middle cranial fossa measures up to 17 mm in greatest diameter and is slightly decreased compared to the earlier measurements of 19 mm (2:7).  A curvilinear hyperdense focus along the lateral border of the right middle cranial fossa measures 7 mm in short-axis diameter.  This may also represent an epidural hematoma (2:8).  Hyperdense focus with mild surrounding edema located more superiorly overlying the right temporal lobe is stable compared to the previous CT.  Mild shift of normally midline structures of approximately 3 mm to the right is stable.  No new foci of hemorrhage are noted.  The -white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved.

Comparison is made to the prior study of . TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT. FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left temporoparietal craniotomy.  The residual left temporal epidural hematoma measures 17 mm which is unchanged compared to the prior study.  The right temporal epidural hematoma is also unchanged measuring 7 mm in the short axis.  The right frontal epidural hematoma is also unchanged in size.  The mass effect of the extraaxial hemorrhage in the left temporal region has improved with improvement in the left uncal herniation.  4-mm rightward subfalcine herniation is also unchanged.  Diffuse opacification of the ethmoid, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses are unchanged.  The orogastric tube is partially coiled in the region of the nasopharynx. IMPRESSION: 1.  Status post left temporal craniotomy with stable appearance of the bilateral extra-axial temporal hemorrhage and the right frontal extra-axial hemorrhage. 2.  Interval improvement in the left uncal herniation.  Unchanged subfalcine herniation. , J.
