You had a procedure done to fix the bone. Below arethe reccomendations from the orthopedic doctors:Wound Care:-Keep Incision dry.-Do not soak the incision in a bath or pool.Activity:-Continue to be non weight bearing on your right leg and fullweight bearing on your left leg.Other Instructions- Resume your regular diet.- Avoid nicotine products to optimize healing.- Resume your home medications. Take all medications asinstructed.- Continue taking the Lovenox to prevent blood clots.- You were found to be VERY sensitive to narcotic medications.Please take as small a dose as you can tolerate. Narcotic painmedication may cause drowsiness.  Do not drink alcohol whiletaking narcotic medications.  Do not operate any motor vehicleor machinery while taking narcotic pain medications.  Takingmore than recommended may cause serious breathing problems.If you have questions, concerns or experience any of the belowdanger signs then please call your doctor at  or goto your local emergency room. During this hospitalization, you were noted to have a drop onyour hematocrit (anemia) that was thought initially to be due toa gut source. It is important to follow this up with yourprimary care doctor and a gastroenterologist. You say that youhave never had a colonoscopy, it is very important to get onewithin the next few months.During this admission, you were also found to have a pneumonia,thought likely due to aspiration when you were on narcotics. Youwere treated with antibiotics. Please continue to takeantibiotics for a total 8 day course.After talking to the vascular surgeons, the decision was made torestart your coumadin to protect your body from clots. Your goalINR is 1.8-2.5 while you are on the 30 day course of Lovenox.After you complete the lovenox, resume the coumadin for a goalINR .You heart rate was found to be fast occasionally. We increasedyour medications to protect your heart and prevent it from goingto fast.The following changes were made to your medications:STOP Gabapentin 100mg TID. You may resume this in rehab or withyour primary care doctor.  12.5 twice a day. You may resume then in rehab orwith your primary care doctor. While in the hospital or rehabyou may get insulin sliding scale. It is very important toresume this after you leave rehab. The rehab facility may wishto start this while you are there.CHANGE: Metoprolol 25mg twice a day--> Metoprolol succinate150mg daily.START: Lovenox 40mg inject yourself once a day for an entiremonth. Follow up with the orthopedic doctors to determine whento stop this.CONTINUE: couamdin 2.5mg daily.  Your new INR goal is 1.8-2.5while you are also taking Lovenox. When you stop the lovenox,you may resume your regular coumadin for the goal INR .START: Diltiazem 120mg daily (long acting)START: Vancomycin 1,000mg , Cefepine 2g , Flagyl 500mgTID, last day is on .START: Pantoprazole 40mg dailySTART: Thiamine 100 units dailySTART:Oxycodone 2.5mg every 6 hrsSTART: Morphine sulfate 0.5mg IV as needed every 2 hrs for painFollowup Instructions:You have an orthopedic appointment scheduled below.

COMPARISON:  CXR ,  from . FINDINGS:  A single AP view of the chest was obtained.  Low lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal diffusion, consolidation or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Osseous structures are intact.

Rule out acute process. COMPARISON:  . FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a right lower lung opacity has newly appeared.  The opacity is relatively extensive and ill-defined.  The predominant pattern is alveolar, multiple air bronchograms are seen.  The very basis of change consists of parenchymal consolidation. There is a minimal right basal pleural effusion. Also newly appeared is a small left retrocardiac opacity. Unchanged minimal cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema. Unchanged dense and minimally widened upper mediastinum. IMPRESSION:  Newly appeared right basal, relatively extensive parenchymal opacity, most likely due to pneumonia or aspiration. Mild retrocardiac opacity, probably reflecting atelectasis. The referring physician, .  was notified by telephone at the time of dictation, 8:43 a.m., .  He confirmed that the pneumonia was known and that the patient was transferred to the MICU for this reason.  5:30 PM HIP 1 VIEW IN O.R.

Evaluate for PE. COMPARISON:  CTA chest . TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest with and without the administration of IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed. FINDINGS:  Pulmonary arterial vasculature is well visualized to the subsegmental level.  No filling defects to indicate a pulmonary embolism are identified.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted bilaterally, however lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement. Calcified granulomas are once again noted within the left lower lobe and the right middle lobe.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear. This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  Within this limitation, upper abdominal structures appear unremarkable. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No focal lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy are identified. IMPRESSION: 1.  No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 2.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
