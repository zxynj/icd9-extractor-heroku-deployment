Admission Date:        Discharge Date:      Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old admitted for cardiogenic shock the morning of admission.  The morning prior to admission, the patient was not feeling well.  She shoveled snow during the day, felt short of breath and sweaty during this.  After she came in, she continued to feel poorly and called her daughter.  She presented to the   ED 12 hours after the initial onset of discomfort with an 02 saturation of 87%, BP 159/76, pulse 119.  She denied chest pain but had some epigastric pain and was noted to have inferior ST elevations and atrial fibrillation.  She was given aspirin, Plavix, heparin, Integrelin, and Lopressor.  Later, at  , she had frothy pink sputum and became hypotensive and unresponsive.  She was intubated and put on pressors with response.  The laboratories were consistent with a myocardial infarction.  She was transferred to   for emergent catheterization.  She was found to have a 20% left main, LAD proximally occluded after D1, 80% ramus, 100% proximal circumflex, 80% proximal RCA with a total occlusion of the distal RCA with an elevated wedge pressure.  The right coronary artery lesions were crossed and stented.  During the procedure, she had difficulty oxygenating and was paralyzed with an increased FI02 and PEEP.  She arrived to the CCU unstable on dopamine, Integrelin with a balloon pump. Her heart rate began to drop and then became more hypotensive.  She was treated with Atropine and epi with no response and CPR was started for a PEA code.  An emergent echocardiogram showed no evidence of tamponade and no cardiac motion.  She eventually responded after 15 minutes to the above treatments as well as bicarbonate, calcium, and several more doses of epi and Atropine.  A stat crit showed a 12 point hematocrit drop and she had blood oozing from her nose, mouth, and NG tube.  Integrelin was stopped.  ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to codeine.  MEDICATIONS AT HOME: 1.  Glucotrol. 2.  Plavix. 3.  Lasix. 4.  Avandia.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  Diabetes.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Her neck was supple.  Her pupils were fixed and dilated.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with balloon sounds.  Lungs:  Clear anteriorly but decreased breath sounds posteriorly.  Abdomen:  Her belly was soft.  Extremities:  She had a right groin hematoma and no lower extremity edema.  LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The EKG showed persistent ST elevations in III greater than II with lateral depressions and atrial fibrillation at a rate of 106.  lactate on admission was 9.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  Within an hour, the patient began to decompensate again with 02 saturations   in the 70s with a good wave form.  A repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates with no pneumothorax and ET tube in good position.  The patient began to get bradycardiac again with drop in BP.  Atropine was given and pressures were increased. The ABG showed a pH of 7.13, lactate 15.  This was discussed with the Cardiology Fellow, intern, and the patient's daughter about the very grim prognosis due to extensive CAD with cardiogenic shock and poor forward cardiac output. Discussed that we were currently resuscitating the patient but agreed to no further chest compressions or shocks. Discussed this with her brother as the patient continued to get more bradycardiac, hypotensive, and eventually arrested at 8:45 a.m. and was not resucitated.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Cardiogenic shock secondary to inferior myocardial infarction. 2.  Diabetes. 3.  Hypertension.                                  , M.D.     Dictated By:   MEDQUIST36  D:     02:02 T:     20:39 JOB#:         Junctional rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions. ST segment elevations in leads II, III and aVF suggest ongoing inferior ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 the junctional rhythm is new and the Q-T interval is considerably longer. Clinical correlation is suggested. TRACING #2   Sinus tachycardia. Q waves in leads II, III and aVF with concomitant ST segment elevations suggest inferior myocardial infarction of undetermined age. Borderline low limb lead voltage. A-V conduction delay. Q-T interval prolongation. No previous tracing available for comparison. TRACING #1     6:20 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip #    Reason: CHF VS ARDS  ______________________________________________________________________________    MEDICAL CONDITION:   84 year old woman with S/P INF MI, S/P RCA STENTS, S/P PEA CODE.  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:   CHF VS ARDS  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  PORTABLE CHEST:   INDICATION: Respiratory failure s/p code. Clinical suspicion for congestive  heart failure or ARDS.   An intra-aortic balloon pump is present, with the distal tip terminating  slightly less than 1 cm below the top of the aortic knob. A Swan-Ganz catheter  terminates in the descending left pulmonary artery, and an ETT terminates  approximately 5 cm above the carina.   The heart is not enlarged. The lungs reveal bilateral asymmetric alveolar  pattern affecting the right upper lobe and left lower lobe to the greatest  degree. There is biapical thickening vs. pleural fluid. Blunting of left  costophrenic sulcus is also noted.   IMPRESSION: 1) Lines and tubes, positioned as described above.   2) Asymmetric bilateral alveolar pattern without evidence of cardiac  enlargement or vascular engorgement. The appearance would favor pneumonia,  aspiration or ARDS over congestive heart failure.
