The discomfort radiated to the jaw left arm. He took one sublingual nitroglycerin and the pain improved, but never went away. At 2:30 PM he went to   for further evaluation at the advice of his endocrinologist. He had a positive troponin and a concerning EKG. He received one dose of SL nitro. He left AMA because he had to take care of his mother.   then took a cab to the ED here. He reported lots of anterior chest pain when walking in to the ED. .

Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old man with hypertension and diabetes s/p STEMI on  . . # CAD: He had a ruptured plaque with 80-90% stenosis of the LAD with successful PCI of the proximal and mid LAD with nonoverlapping 3.0 x 12 mm Promus Element     to 3.25 mm (distal) and 3.75 x 16 mm Promus Element     to 3.75 mm (proximal). He was chest pain free after cath and admitted to the CCU. Biomarkers peaked at MB 146, trops 10, and have since downtrended . He will remain on aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg  , atorvastatin 80 mg, continue home lisinopril 40 mg, Metop 25  . Echo was performed and showed an LVEF of 50% with mild hypokinesis. . # Hypertension: Continued on home lisinopril. Well controlled . # Diabetes: He is on metformin at home. However, given his recent contrast load, he was placed on insulin sliding scale and add glipizide 5 mg  . He was discharged back on metformin with plan to followup with outpatient endocrinologist. . # BPH: Patient reports having symptoms of BPH. He takes saw   at home.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis (distal anterior wall and true apex are not well seen). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.    Sinus bradycardia.  Prolonged Q-T interval.  Compared to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are similar. TRACING #4   Sinus rhythm.  Anterior ST segment elevations with T wave inversions across the precordium.  Compared to the previous tracing further evolution of anterior myocardial infarction. TRACING #3   Sinus rhythm.  ST segment elevation with T wave inversion in leads V2-V4. Subtle inferolateral ST segment depression.  Compared to the previous tracing there has been resolution of anterolateral myocardial infarction with interval reduction and ST-T wave changes. TRACING #2   Sinus rhythm.  ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL and V1-V3 with ST segment deperssion in leads II, III, aVF and V5-V6 suggestive of acute anterolateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.  No previous tracing available for comparison. TRACING #1
