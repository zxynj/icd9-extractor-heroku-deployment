He received cipro/flagyl.  2 PIVs were placed and received 2L NS.  He did not receive blood. . He was seen by GI who felt that he may warrant a colonoscopy initially, but decided given his stable picture to defer for now. . On arrival to the MICU, he is comfortable and without any complaints.

Compared to prior, there is new central pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is no confluent consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, as are the osseous and soft tissue structures. IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Thickened bladder wall with surrounding stranding potentially secondary to cystitis and correlation with UA suggested. 2. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma. 3. Hypodense lesions in each kidney likely represent cysts, however, not fully characterized on nonenhanced CT scan. If desired US could help characterize. 4. Enlarged prostate.   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yom with history of a.fib, on pradaxa, now presenting with worsening BRBPR and hematuria . # GI Bleed: Patient was monitored in the MICU overnight for GIB given pradaxa use.  He remained normotensive throughout his MICU stay without drop in Hct.  He was evaluated by GI who felt no urgent colonoscopy was needed, and symptoms were likely secondary hemorrhoidal and exacerbated by anticoagulation.  He was transferred to the medical floor where he remained stable o/n.  After discussion with Dr.   the patient's out- patient cardiologist, given the fact that he has been in sinus for the better part of a year and has not flipped into AFIB he was d/c'd on full dose ASA with GI f/u scheduled. . # UTI: Patient was started on ciprofloxacin for UTI as evidenced by UA and dysuria.  He was subsequently switched to cefpodoxime given concern for prolonged QTc in combination with amiodarone. Micro showed a sensitive E. Coli. . # Afib: Patient remained in sinus rhythm.  Anticoagulation was initially held, then switched to ASA as above.  #  : Creatinine was 2.0 on admission, improving to 1.2 the following day and 1.0 on the day of discharge.  Thought to be secondary to volume depletion.  # Wheezing: Patine twas initially slightly wheezy on exam thoguht to be sedcondary to mild volume overload.  The following day pulmonary exam had improved, patient was comfortable on room air.  He refused scripts for inhalers at home, saying he only needs them when he is sick.  . # Hypertension: Home medications initially held in the MICU, were restarted after patient demonstrated hemodynamic stability and transferred to the floor.  Did well from this standpoint until discharge.

WET READ VERSION #1  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  INDICATION:  67-year-old male with bright red blood per rectum and left side  pain and renal failure, question retroperitoneal bleed.   TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without  administration of contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.   COMPARISON:  None available.   FINDINGS:  The lung bases are clear.  The visualized heart and pericardium are  unremarkable.   The examination of the intra-abdominal organs is limited due to noncontrast  technique.  Given this limitation, the liver, pancreas, spleen and adrenal  glands are unremarkable.  There is a 1.5-cm round hypodense lesion in the  interpolar region of the left kidney.  There is a 4-cm round hypodense lesion  in the superior pole of the right kidney.  These may represent cysts, however,  cannot be fully characterized on noncontrast CT scan.  The ureters are  unremarkable.  The bladder wall is thickened and indistinct with some  surrounding fat stranding indicating probable cystitis.  The prostate is  enlarged.  The seminal vesicles are unremarkable.    The stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum are unremarkable.  The appendix is  not visualized; however, there is no evidence of appendicitis.  There is no  free fluid.  There is no free air.  The intra-abdominal vasculature is  unremarkable; however, evaluation is limited due to lack of IV contrast.  There are no hernias identified.   There are moderate degenerative changes of lower thoracic and lumbar spine,  most prominent at L3 through S1 with joint space narrowing and anterior and  posterior osteophytes.  No fractures or suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions  are identified.
