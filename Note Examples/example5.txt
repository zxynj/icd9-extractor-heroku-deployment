Admission Date:          Discharge Date:     Date of Birth:           Sex:  M  Service:  PLAS    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 19 year old male from   with a history of motor vehicle accident three years ago with residual right lower extremity common peroneal nerve injury who had undergone triple joint fusion of the foot on  .  His postoperative course was complicated by wound infection and dehiscence with exposure of tendons and bone on the dorsum of the right foot.  The patient was treated with Keflex postoperatively but then one week later had increased swelling, hematoma and some drainage with necrosis of the skin with exposing tendons and bone. The patient was treated with p.o. Levofloxacin and followed with intravenous Levofloxacin.  The patient is unsure about the duration of the antibiotics, but reports being on antibiotics since  .  The patient denies fevers, chills and night sweats.  Also the patient with a foot ulceration on the right heel while in the hospital.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Motor vehicle accident three years ago; has plate and screws of the fusion and had undergone an arterial bypass graft (femoral to popliteal on the right).  Also, has a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus during hospitalization post Intensive Care Unit.  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.  Triple joint fusion of the right foot  .  MEDICATIONS: 1.  Levaquin.  ALLERGIES:   Question of Ativan when given in Intensive Care Unit with psychosis.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, a well appearing male. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  There is no cervical lymphadenopathy.  Heart sounds are regular with a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Right leg shows a lateral fasciotomy scar, medial fasciotomy skin graft, hammer toes, dry plantar skin; no plantar sensation.  There is an ulcer granulating the right heel, 1 by 1 cm at the dorsum of the foot; there is a 4 by 5 cm ulcer with debridement   in place and exposed tendons.  The wound looks deep centrally, granulating at the margins.  LABORATORY: X-ray of the right foot shows calcaneus, talus fusion screw and navicular staples times two.  No signs of osteomyelitis.  IMPRESSION:  The wound was debrided in the   Clinic, dressings were applied.  PLAN:  The patient was admitted to the Plastic Surgery service for further debridement and wound care.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  On  , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where his right foot was debrided by Dr.  .  The patient was started on Levofloxacin and received Percocet for pain.  The next day, the patient had an MRI / MRA of the right lower extremity to evaluate the extent of the infection and to evaluate the blood vessels (study has not been read yet).  On postoperative day two, the wound looked satisfactory to the team and a VAC was placed.  Postoperatively, the patient was also started on Vancomycin prophylactically.  The patient with a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from previous admission.  On  , Infectious Disease Service was consulted who evaluated the patient and recommended appropriate antibiotic treatment.  Nutritional consultation was also requested for patient's nutritional support.  On  , the patient's vac was changed; wound was granulating well with no signs of infection or purulence.  According to the Infectious Disease Service recommendations, the patient's antibiotics were changed to Ceftazidime, Flagyl, and Vancomycin was continued; Levofloxacin was discontinued.  On  , the patient as taken back to the Operating Room for a free gracilis muscle flap from the left thigh to the dorsum of the right foot and split thickness skin graft from the right thigh on the dorsum of the right foot by Dr.  .  The patient was continued on Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Flagyl per Infectious Disease recommendations.  He was also started on aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.  Flap checks were performed q. 15 minutes for the first eight hours followed by q. 30 minutes for the next eight hours followed by q. one hour the last eight hours of the day, and the next day the flap checks were progressed to q. two hours in the Intensive Care Unit setting.  The patient's pain was controlled with intravenous morphine and eventually p.o. percocet.  On  , the patient was able to tolerate clears and on the 7th, his diet was switched to a regular diet and he was transferred to the Floor in stable condition.  On  , again following Infectious Disease recommendations, the patient's antibiotics were switched to Vancomycin intravenously at 1250 mg p.o. twice a day and Levofloxacin p.o. and Flagyl p.o.  On  , the patient started foot dangling for progressively longer periods of time.  A PICC line was placed on the   for home intravenous infusion of Vancomycin.  Of note, foot culture on the   had only grown Staphylococcus coagulase negative.  The patient was discharged on the   home with visiting nurse services for wound care.  The patient is to continue taking intravenous Vancomycin by his PICC line, Levofloxacin, Flagyl, for a total of six weeks per Infectious Disease.  DISPOSITION:   Home with   Services.  CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Good.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six hours. 2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 3.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. three times a day for 37 days. 4.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day for 37 days. 5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day. 6.  Lactulose 30 ml p.o. q. eight p.r.n. 7.  Vancomycin 1250 mg intravenously twice a day for 37 days.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Right foot infection status post right foot debridement with VAC placement. 2.  Status post free gracilis flap from left leg and split thickness skin graft from right thigh to the right foot and ankle.                                    , M.D.     Dictated By:  MEDQUIST36  D:     15:16 T:     15:10 JOB#:       9:52 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip #    Reason: Please check placement of right basilic PICC line  please pa  Admitting Diagnosis: OPEN WOUND,RIGHT FOOT  ______________________________________________________________________________    MEDICAL CONDITION:   19 year old man with right foot wound infection  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:   Please check placement of right basilic PICC line  please page IV nurse    wet  .  thanks #   ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  INDICATION:  19 year old man with right foot wound infection.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal, and  hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lung  fields are clear. There are no pleural effusions.

TECHNIQUE:  MR angiography of the legs from the calf through the ankle.  Multiplanar reconstructions were also performed and evaluated.   FINDINGS:  There is three-vessel runoffs bilaterally.  Arterial and venous  flow are both seen earlier in the right leg, consistent with hyperemia related  to injury.  In the right leg, all three runoff vessels are of good caliber.  The peroneal artery is patent to the ankle.  The anterior tibial artery  continues into a dorsalis pedis.  A small portion of the distal anterior  tibial artery is obscured due to susceptibility artifact from orthopedic  hardware.  However, a dorsalis pedis artery of good caliber is seen more  distally.  The posterior tibial artery is patent into the foot.   Multiplanar reconstructions were used for the evaluation in the patient of the  findings described above.   IMPRESSION:  Normal tibial arterial anatomy, bilaterally.  Hyperemia in right  foot and leg consistent with injury.
