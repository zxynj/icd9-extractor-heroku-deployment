Admission Date:                 Discharge Date:       Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: A.C.E Inhibitors  Attending:  Chief Complaint: jaw and chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath. s/p Stent placment.   History of Present Illness:  yo Russian speaking only F with MI x2, s/p RCA hepacoat stents x5   who presents with chest pain from   Rehab. According to her, she woke up at midnight with jaw pain and then developed   dull substernal chest pain that radiates to her jaw and both of her arms. She was short of  , dizzy, diaphoretic, denies nausea ir palpitations. She went to get a glass of water, thought that may relieve her discomfort, but did not help. 3NTG were given at the rehab, it helped the chest discomfort, but did not relieve jaw pain and she was thus sent to the ED. . In ED, her intial vitals were HR 55 BP 180/80 R 20 Sat 100% on NRB. EKG showed ST elevation in III and AVF and ST depression in I and AVL. Bedside echo showed inferior hypokinesis. She was started on heparin, integrillin and nitroglycerin gtt's and was given additional ASA, betablocker, and plavix and was taken to the cath lab urgently. Code status was discussed in the ED and was determined that she wants to be full code. Prior to transfer to the cath lab, she had some mild chest pressure and she felt that her breathing had improved. . Of note,   she was found to have a thrombosed RCA with PCI and 3 vessel disease. RCA was successfully stented with hepacoat stents x5. Her last stress   showed mild reversible apical defect. Last echo  : EF >65%, LVH, no wma,   Past Medical History: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2. Pacemaker (Pacesetter A-V pacer) placement for sick sinus syndrome (installed for bradycardia) 3. Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 6.

The aorta is unfolded with mural calcification.  A left-sided pacemaker is in place with dual electrodes in unchanged position.  The pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits, without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is mild focal linear and nodular opacity at the right base laterally, the finding that is unchanged and could relate to costal cartilage calcification. No focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation is identified.  The osseous structures appear unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1.  Cardiomegaly without definite evidence of congestive heart failure. 2.  No pleural effusions. No pneumonia. . EKG: STE's in inferior leads.  : LMCA: normal with calcification LAD: Prox calcification with mid-segment 95% bifurcation lesion with the D2. LCx: Non-dominant with mid-segment 95% lesion at a trifurcation with OM1-3. RCA: Dominant with previous stents noted, mid-segment occlusion.  Distal flow from L-R collaterals. Intervention (preliminary) RCA re-stented x 5.  . EKG:   1:57: a-paced with STE V1, III, aVF, ST depr aVL, V3-V6.  . Echo  : EF 65-75%  No AR, trivial MR.  LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.  Mod symmetric LVH.    cardiac cath COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel disease. The LMCA was normal with modest calcification. The LAD had modest proximal calcification with mid segment 95% bifurcation lesion with the D2. The LCX had mid-segment 95% stenosis at the trifurcation with OM1-3. The RCA had total mid segment occlusion. 2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated elevated systemic pressures. 3. Successful dottering and predilation using 2.0 X 20 Voyager balloon, stenting using 2.5 X 18 Rx, 3.0 X 23,OTW  3.0 X 28 OTW, 3.5 X 28 OTW and 3.5 X 23 OTW Cypher stents followed by postdilation using 4.0 X 20 Quantum Maverick balloon of the acutely occluded mid RCA with lesion reduction from 100 % to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.

PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION.   Brief Hospital Course: () Cardiac: a) Ischemia: history of thrombus to RCA with TO of RCA and 5 hepacoat stents.  Now with new thrombotic occlusion to mid-RCA and s/p placement of hepacot x5 to RCA. Treated with integrillin for 18 hrs and briefly for nitrogtt post cath. - Continue plavix, O2, aspirin, statin, metoprolol - On Lopressor to 50 tid. - Initially Imdur held given hypotension and thereafter restarted at 60mg.  This can be titrated up as BP tolerates. . b) pump: history of hypertension and diastolic dysfunction with symmetric LVH and impaired LV relaxation.  Last EF in   was >65%, estimated EF in bedside echo was around 50% - continue on po lasix, beta-blockade for rate control. - Held outpatient meds: valsartan(  on  CRI), initially held imdur but restarted isosorbine MN at lower dose on  . Titrate up if needed . c) rhythm- h/o atrial pacemaker placement in   for sinus brady, has two leads - Continue beta-blockade for rate control. . # Groin hematoma:  Pt noted to have a small groin hematoma day after cath.  Hemodynamically stable.  No bruit appreciated.  Pt was monitored and there were no changes. . # leucocytosis - Pt noted to have leucocytosis upto 18.  She was afebrile and did not complain of anything.  CXR was unrevealing for infection.  She had positive urine culture with E. coli on   and was started on levoflox.  The next day patient had some productive sputumand a Temp of 100.8.  A PA lateral CXR was only suggestive of some pulmonary congestion but no clear infiltrate. She should be continued for UTI treatment for total 7 days.  If she has a temperature spike may consider evaluation by PCP. . # Renal: h/o CRI due to hypertensive nephropathy and   likely due to dye load from the cath lab. - renally dose all medications. - Patient should have CHEM 7 including creatine checked in 2 days. . # Endocrine: history of hypothyroidism, continue synthroid. . # Heme: Anemia secondary to decreased production/chronic hypertensive kidney disease, held aranesp and iron while in-house.
