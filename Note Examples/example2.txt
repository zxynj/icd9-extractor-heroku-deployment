Patient was originially admitted on   with a complaint of cough and thick expectorations, shortness of breath and desaturations. She was found to have RLL and RML infiltrations as well as bilateral pulmonary venous congestion on her admission CXR. She was started IV vanc and meropenem for coverage of hospital aquired organsims given a reccent hospitaliation in   for ESBL UTI. She was maintained on noninvasive ventilation and diuresed with lasix given an elevated BNP of 214 on admission. Her COPD exacerbation was treated with IV solumedrol initially and then she was transitioned to PO prednisone 40 mg daily. She was eventually discharged from the ICU at   and maintained on the floor. During her floor stay she was noted to be sloly retaining more CO2 and then intubated on   for a pH of 7.19, pCO2 70. Her pressures were declining over the 24 hours prior to transfer and despite NS boluses required initiation of norepinephrine and hydrocortisone. Her mental status after call out from the ICU continued to be altered and she had a NCHCT as well as EEG which did not show any acute processes. An CXR performed the day of transfer showed a bilateral lower lobe infiltrate suggestive of aspiration. . On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 99.4, 115, 123/60, 97%RA. Patient was intubated and sedated.

Right effusion probably due to failure.  CXR  : FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of  , the right IJ catheter has been removed.  Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  CXR  : Comparison is made to prior study  .  Severe cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Right perihilar consolidation has increased.  Bibasilar opacities, a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent consolidations, are improving on the left though the component of pleural effusion on the right has minimally increased.

NOT FUMIGATUS OR  .   Brief Hospital Course: Brief ICU Course: 82 yo w/ hx of COPD, dCHF, Afib, aortic stenosis who was transferred from an outside hosputal for hospitalization complicated by ESBL UTI (treated), pneumonia with worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She preogressed to multi-organ failure and family decision was made to keep the patient comfortable but not to escalate care. The patient died on   from cardiopulmonary failure.  Active Issues: # Hypotension: The patient presented from outside hospital on norepinephrine. This was weaned off within 12 hours of admission. She was started on a methylprednisolone taper, given her COPD and past history of steroid use. The most likely etiology for her hypotension was sepsis. Her blood pressures were maintained with intermittent IVF boluses.  # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient presented from outside hospital intubated for respiratory failure. Her blood gas was most consistent with a respiratory acidosis with concurrent mild metabolic acidosis. Possible etiologies included pneumonia (likely HCAP given recent hospitalization), COPD exacerbation, and volume overload. She completed a course of vancomycin and meropenem for HCAP. Once her blood pressures stabilized, diuresis was attempted with lasix 20mg/hr and metolazone 5mg PO BID. She had extended spontaneous breathing trials but persistent respiratory acidosis, and was unable to wean off the ventilator. She was maintained on pressure support ventilation, and in light of her multisystem organ failure, family decision was made not to escalate ventilator settings. She was given morphine for dyspnea and respiratory distress.  # Progressive Multiorgan Dysfunction: Patient had progressive renal failure, as well as likely severe aortic stenosis unresponsive to fluid.  Also with aortic stenosis, may not be perfusing forward. She has a history of a-fib and diastolic CHF. She had question of cardiogenic vs. distributive shock originally. Organ failure was progressive and family did not want to advance care beyond supportive measures.  # Renal Failure: Patient had progressive renal failure as discussed above. Likely due to poor perfusion in setting of shock and aortic stenosis. We stopped checking labs and she was not a dialysis candidate considering goals of care.  # Aortic Stenosis: Valve area of 0.96 on recent ECHO, qualifies as severe, low peak gradient may have been underestimate depending on patient's volume status and LVEDV at the time of exam. Likely major contributor to her mutliorgan failure by poor forward perfusion. ECHO was held given goals of care.  # Pneumonia: The patient had evidence of pneumonia on CXR. Given her recent history of hospitalization in  , she was empirically treated for HCAP with vnacomycin and meropenem. Her sputum culture grew only yeast and mold, most likely related to colonization in an intubated patient.  # Anemia: On admission, the patient's HCT was 25, which was decreased from the outside hospital. Her HCT decreased to a nadir of 24.6 and she was transfused 1U PRBC with appropriate response. There was no evidence of active bleeding.  # Elevated INR: The patient's INR on presentation was 6.1. Workup for DIC was negative. Her coumadin was held and she was given vitamin K and her INR decreased to 1.3. Given her history of PE, she was placed on a heparin drip and restarted on coumadin 4mg daily for a goal INR of  .  # Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet counts dropped slowly during her admission, reaching a nadir of 22,000 on  . HIT antibodies were negative. DIC workup was negative. The most likely etiology of her thrombocytopenia was antibiotic effect or bone marrow suppression from infection. Lab draws were discontinued later in the course on the patient's hospitalization for comfort.  Inactive Issues: # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient as continued on her home ditiazem dose and was well controlled with that dose. Anticoagulation with Coumadin was reversed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and concern for spontaneous bleed.  # Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm:  Did not appear to be active extravasation. We did not pursue contrast study for further evaluation however given the patient's goals of care.  # Uterine Mass: Visualized on abdominal CT. Cannot rule out endometrial carcinoma. We did not pursue transvaginal ultrasound given overall clinical picture and goals of care.  # Hypertension: We held antihypertensives given sepsis.  Transitions of Care: 1. Code: DNR 2.

COMPARISON:  None available.   TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were acquired  without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were  reviewed.   FINDINGS:   CHEST:  The lung bases demonstrate moderate bilateral pleural effusions with  adjacent atelectasis.  There is underlying emphysema.  A 2.5 x 1 cm nodular  density in the right lung, probably located in right middle lobe, with  internal foci of cavitation is concerning for infection.  Additional smaller  nodular opacities in the lower lungs, right greater than left, are concerning  for infection.  Dense aortic and coronary artery calcifications are partially  imaged.  Trace pericardial fluid is seen.  An esophageal catheter terminates  in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.   ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of intra-abdominal organs is limited in the absence of  intravenous contrast.  Within this limitation, the liver, spleen, atrophic  pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys demonstrate no acute abnormalities.  Calcifications in the regions of the renal hila are likely arterial  calcifications. The patient is status post cholecystectomy and surgical clips  are seen in the gallbladder fossa.  There is a moderate amount of ascites.  Visualized loops of bowel demonstrate no acute abnormalities; colonic  diverticula do not demonstrate evidence for acute inflammation.  Calcification  in the region of the splenic hilum may represent calcification of a tortuous  splenic artery though splenic artery aneurysm cannot be excluded.  There is  extensive arterial atherosclerotic calcification along the abdominal aorta and  iliac arteries with a suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, which measures 3.7  x 4.2 cm in the axial plane, and an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that  measures 5.0 x 4.9 cm (2:36).  A crescent of relative   along the  wall of this aneurysm (2:34) may represent mural thrombus, but evaluation is  limited in the absence of intravenous contrast.  There is no free  intraperitoneal air.  There is extensive diffuse subcutaneous edema.   Within an ascitic pocket in the left mid abdomen there is ill defined    that is located adjacent to bowel loops but does not clearly  represent bowel (2:45, 301b:26).  However, lack of any contrast opacification  in this study severely limits assessment.  The remainder of abdominal ascites  is of low density.   PELVIS:  The uterus is markedly enlarged with a centrally located 8.6 x 8.5 cm  hypodense mass that could represent a uterine fibroid although its large size                                                              (Over)     9:48 PM  CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST                                    Clip #    Reason: please evaluate for RP bleed, any bleeding source  Admitting Diagnosis: ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME;CHRONIC   PULM DISEASE  Field of view: 50  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  (Cont)  in this age group is atypical and endometrial malignancy cannot be excluded.
